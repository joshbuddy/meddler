= Meddler

== Hey, someone meddled with my middleware!

This lets you have on_request and on_response wrappers around a builder, and optionally skip them in either case.

== Usage

In your rackup file, do this:

  require 'meddler'
  use Meddler::Builder, :on_request => proc{|req| req.post?} do
    use MungePostMiddleware
  end

Or, on response

  require 'meddler'
  use Meddler::Builder, :on_response => proc{|resp| resp.status == 200} do
    use MiddlewareThatLikesOkThings
  end
